# Red_Onion-Price_Forecasting_Machine_Learning
The onion price  forecasting research was performed for Sri Lankan framing Industries. The model can be use for required stocks , Prices and Quantity forecasting. 
The Forecating was performed using five Machine Learning Models. 
         1. Auto Regression Model.
         2. Random Forest Regression Model.
         3. Moving Average Model. 
         4. ARIMA
         5. LSTM
The models has serveral dataset and it is focued on jaffna district.
